            <p>Short version: focused fundamentals, lots of packet-level labs, structured practice tests, and scheduled review.</p>

            <h2>Study plan</h2>
            <p>Break the objectives into networking domains (OSI model, IP addressing/routing, switching, wireless, security). I used 1–2 week blocks per major domain with hands-on labs and flashcards for memorization.</p>

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Official exam objectives — use as a checklist.</li>
                <li>Video course plus a concise Network+ book for reference.</li>
                <li>Packet-tracing tools (Wireshark) and small VM/network lab for practice.</li>
                <li>Question banks to simulate exam timing and to identify weak areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hands-on labs</h2>
            <p>Set up basic topologies to practice subnetting, routing, VLANs, ACLs, and wireless configuration. Inspect traffic with Wireshark — understanding packets made theoretical questions trivial.</p>

            <h2>Exam day tips</h2>
            <p>Rest well beforehand, bring a printed formula cheat-sheet for quick review (where allowed), read multi-step scenarios carefully, and eliminate impossible answers first.</p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            <p>Consistent hands-on practice combined with targeted question review made the biggest difference. Good luck.</p>
