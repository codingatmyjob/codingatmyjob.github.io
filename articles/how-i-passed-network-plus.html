            <h2>Study plan</h2>
            <p>Let me start by saying I have a very strong networking background with almost 4 years on cisco networking equipment, 
            so I didn't think this was going to be a very challenging exam. I basically chalked it up to a resume filler. It 
            took me 30 days and I used 4 sources to study. I started by watching Professor Messer's Network+ YouTube 
            series to gauge my overall level of preparedness. I then purchased Jason Dion's Network+ Udemy course that came 
            with a free practice exam to get a second teaching style for the areas I was struggling with (mainly cables, connector 
            types, and wireless standards - all the frustrating memorization). At this point I could explain most of the exam objectives pretty well. I finished with 
            Andrew Ramdayal's free Network+ practice test on YouTube. If you plan on purchasing a Udemy course, wait until there's 
            a sale on the course or you'll spend way more money than you need to.</p>

            <h2>Was the Exam Worth it?</h2>
            <p>I think it depends where you are in your career. This is a great vendor neutral cert that teaches you a lot about
            networks and network protocols. If you're looking to get into networking, IT, or cybersecurity, this is a great starting point. If you already have a
            strong networking background, this may not be worth your time and money unless you need it for a job requirement. I'm giving the Net+ a 6.5/10 for value.</p>

            <h2>Exam tips & Parting Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Review what you can the morning of your exam, and data dump what you need on the provided dry erase board. Skip over 
            and save the PBQs for last, read questions carefully, and flag any questions you're unsure of to return to later. 
            Network+ N10-009 is a very straightforward exam for those who come prepared. Good luck!</p>
