            <p>Short version: structured study, lots of practice questions, and put in the hours.</p>

            <h2>Study plan</h2>
            <p>I had roughly five weeks between finishing Net+ and my scheduled Security+ exam. I studied consistently — about 2–4 hours 
            most weeknights and 4–6 hours on weekends — focusing solely on Security+. I started with Jason Dion’s Udemy course to 
            build a solid foundation, then moved on to Professor Messer’s YouTube series to reinforce and touch up on any topics 
            that I still didn't fully understand. After about two and a half weeks of coursework I shifted to practice exams: 
            Jason Dion’s tests to identify weak objectives, and Sybex’s sectional tests to drill each domain. By exam day I could 
            confidently explain each of the objectives and felt prepared. In the resources listed below I've included all my study sources, 
            and the listed price I bought them for. Let me say this: If you've never used Udemy before, sign up, and wait for a sale. 
            Check the course pricing on Udemy daily, there's basically a sale every week.</p>

            <h2>Study & Exam day tips</h2>
            <p>Learn the acronyms! Security+ is the most acronym‑heavy exam I’ve taken, with well over 200 terms (some even overlap). 
            Focus your extended study on the objectives where your practice scores are weakest. Before the exam, get a good night’s 
            sleep and a light study session in the morning. In the test, skip performance‑based questions at first and return to them later; 
            pace yourself through the multiple‑choice section, flag any questions you're unsure of, and revisit them before submitting.</p>

            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            <p>Study whatever way works best for you, and check out study guides on Youtube, Udemy, Reddit, etc. Good luck.</p>
